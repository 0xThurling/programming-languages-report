It's a real shame that this didn't get more discussion because the author raises some good points that would benefit from heated debate. Bun is insanely good. Its single greatest victory is papering over the CJS/ESM nightmare with an "it just works" approach. The speed improvements result in a qualitatively different DX (especially for TS projects) that can feel like a religious experience for how profound the impact can be. And still, the issues raised in this post stand.
